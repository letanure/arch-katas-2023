# ADR04: Establishment of Analytical Warehouse Subsystem for Trip Data Analytics

## Status

Proposed

## Rationale

The RoadWarrior system aims to gather valuable analytical data from users' trips to derive insights about travel trends, preferences, update frequencies, and more. Traditional relational databases and application databases, while efficient for transactional operations, may not be optimized for performing large-scale data analytics. The analytical requirements include:

1. **High-Volume Data Processing**: Analyzing trends and patterns often requires processing large volumes of data in real-time or in batches.
2. **Complex Queries**: The analytical queries could be multi-dimensional and might require aggregations, filtering, and sorting over massive datasets.
3. **Data Storage**: The volume of analytical data could grow exponentially over time, necessitating scalable storage solutions.
4. **Integration with Analytics Tools**: There may be a need to use specialized analytical and visualization tools that work better with dedicated analytical platforms.

Given these needs, there's a requirement for a specialized subsystem tailored for analytical workloads.

## Decision

We've decided to introduce an "Analytical Warehouse Subsystem" for the RoadWarrior system. This subsystem will:

- **Capture Events**: All relevant events generated in the system will be sent to this subsystem for processing.

- **Process and Store Data**: The warehouse will process these events and store data in a format optimized for analytical processing. Depending on the technology choice, this could involve columnar storage, data lakes, or specialized databases.

- **Serve Analytical Queries**: The subsystem will be the primary point for executing complex analytical queries, ensuring that analytical workloads don't interfere with the system's operational tasks.

- **Integration Point**: This warehouse can be integrated with other advanced analytical and visualization tools for more in-depth insights.

## Consequences

- **Performance**: Offloading analytical tasks to a dedicated subsystem ensures that the core system remains performant and isn't bogged down by heavy queries.

- **Scalability**: Analytical warehouses are designed to scale out, allowing for the processing and storage of massive datasets.

- **Complexity**: Introducing a new subsystem can add architectural and operational complexity. Proper documentation, training, and monitoring will be essential.

- **Cost**: Running and maintaining an analytical warehouse might introduce additional costs in terms of infrastructure and management.

- **Data Consistency**: Depending on the data transfer mechanism, there might be a slight lag between event generation and its availability in the warehouse, leading to eventual consistency.

- **Flexibility**: With a dedicated warehouse, the system is poised to adopt more sophisticated analytical and machine learning tools in the future.
